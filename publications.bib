	abstract = {While evolution is often considered from a DNA- and protein-centric view, RNA-based regulation can also impact gene expression and protein sequences. Here we examined interspecies differences in RNA-protein interactions using the conserved neuronal RNA binding protein, Unkempt (UNK) as model. We find that roughly half of mRNAs bound in human are also bound in mouse. Unexpectedly, even when transcript-level binding was conserved across species differential motif usage was prevalent. To understand the biochemical basis of UNK-RNA interactions, we reconstituted the human and mouse UNK-RNA interactomes using a high-throughput biochemical assay. We uncover detailed features driving binding, show that in vivo patterns are captured in vitro, find that highly conserved sites are the strongest bound, and associate binding strength with downstream regulation. Furthermore, subtle sequence differences surrounding motifs are key determinants of species-specific binding. We highlight the complex features driving protein-RNA interactions and how these evolve to confer species-specific regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Summary
RNA interactome studies have revealed that hundreds of zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) are candidate RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), yet their RNA substrates and functional significance remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we present a systematic multi-omics analysis of the DNA- and RNA-binding targets and regulatory roles of more than 100 ZFPs representing 37 zinc-finger families. We show that multiple ZFPs are previously unknown regulators of RNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation, stability, or translation. The examined ZFPs show widespread sequence-specific RNA binding and preferentially bind proximal to transcription start sites. Additionally, several ZFPs associate with their targets at both the DNA and RNA levels. We highlight ZNF277, a C2H2 ZFP that binds thousands of RNA targets and acts as a multi-functional RBP. We also show that ZNF473 is a DNA/RNA-associated protein that regulates the expression and splicing of cell cycle genes. Our results reveal diverse roles for ZFPs in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation.}
