	abstract = {While evolution is often considered from a DNA- and protein-centric view, RNA-based regulation can also impact gene expression and protein sequences. Here we examined interspecies differences in RNA-protein interactions using the conserved neuronal RNA binding protein, Unkempt (UNK) as model. We find that roughly half of mRNAs bound in human are also bound in mouse. Unexpectedly, even when transcript-level binding was conserved across species differential motif usage was prevalent. To understand the biochemical basis of UNK-RNA interactions, we reconstituted the human and mouse UNK-RNA interactomes using a high-throughput biochemical assay. We uncover detailed features driving binding, show that in vivo patterns are captured in vitro, find that highly conserved sites are the strongest bound, and associate binding strength with downstream regulation. Furthermore, subtle sequence differences surrounding motifs are key determinants of species-specific binding. We highlight the complex features driving protein-RNA interactions and how these evolve to confer species-specific regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
