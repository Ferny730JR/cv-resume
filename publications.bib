	abstract = {Summary RNA interactome studies have revealed that hundreds of zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) are candidate RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), yet their RNA substrates and functional significance remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we present a systematic multi-omics analysis of the DNA- and RNA-binding targets and regulatory roles of more than 100 ZFPs representing 37 zinc-finger families. We show that multiple ZFPs are previously unknown regulators of RNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation, stability, or translation. The examined ZFPs show widespread sequence-specific RNA binding and preferentially bind proximal to transcription start sites. Additionally, several ZFPs associate with their targets at both the DNA and RNA levels. We highlight ZNF277, a C2H2 ZFP that binds thousands of RNA targets and acts as a multi-functional RBP. We also show that ZNF473 is a DNA/RNA-associated protein that regulates the expression and splicing of cell cycle genes. Our results reveal diverse roles for ZFPs in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation.}

	abstract = {RNA-protein interactions are pivotal to proper gene regulation. Many RNA-binding proteins possess multiple RNA-binding domains; however, how these domains interplay to specify and regulate RNA targets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three multi-domain proteins, Musashi-1, Musashi-2, and Unkempt, three factors which share a high degree of RNA specificity. We use a combination of massively parallel in vitro assays with random or naturally derived RNA sequences and find that individual domains within a protein can have differing affinities, specificities, and spacing preferences. Further, we emphasize that while all three proteins have overlapping motif specificities, non-overlapping sequences may allow for target discrimination. We carry out large scale competition assays between these proteins and determine how individual protein specificities and affinities influence competitive binding. Integration of in vivo binding and regulation with in vitro specificities shows that target selection involves a combination of the protein intrinsic specificities described here, but cellular context is critical to drive these proteins to motifs in specific transcript regions. Finally, evolutionarily conserved RNA regions display evidence of binding multiple RBPs in vivo, and these RNA regions recapitulate this trend with the highest affinity in vitro. We highlight the importance of understanding features of complex RNA-protein interactions and how protein-target discrimination can be established.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
